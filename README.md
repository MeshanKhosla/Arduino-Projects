# Arduino-Projects
These are the Arduino projects that I've created, including schematics for each project

## [Secret Code](https://github.com/MeshanKhosla/Arduino-Projects/tree/master/Projects/SecretCode)
There is a code that, when entered, lights up an LED and moves a motor

## [Touchless Cubing timer](https://github.com/MeshanKhosla/Arduino-Projects/tree/master/Projects/Touchless-Timer)
A timer for cubing that doesn't require any form of touch. Uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect if a hand is within the threshold.

## [SongPlayer - We Didn't start the fire](https://github.com/MeshanKhosla/Arduino-Projects/tree/master/Projects/SongPlayer_-_We_didn_t_start_the_fire)
I used 5 LEDs, a passive buzzer, and an Arduino Notes library to create the melody for "We Didn't Start The Fire" by Billy Joel.

## [SongPlayer - The Office Theme Song](https://github.com/MeshanKhosla/Arduino-Projects/tree/master/Projects/SongPlayer_-_The_Office_theme_song)
Similar the the WDSTF project, I adjusted the melody to match The Office's theme song

## [The Office theft alarm](https://github.com/MeshanKhosla/Arduino-Projects/tree/master/Projects/Office_Theft_Alarm)
I used a tilt switch to activate an alarm whenever it was activated. For example, if you were to touch the breadboard, it would play The Office theme song.

## [Controlling a Servo with a potentiometer](https://github.com/MeshanKhosla/Arduino-Projects/tree/master/Projects/Servo_with_potentiometer)
I used a small potentiometer to control a servo ranging from 0-180 degrees.

## [Ultrasonic Sensor Alarm](https://github.com/MeshanKhosla/Arduino-Projects/tree/master/Projects/Ultrasonic_alarm)
Ultrasonic sensor with a 50cm threshold. Green light = nothing is in the way. Red light + buzzer = there is something in the way.
