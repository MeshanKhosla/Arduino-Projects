These are the Arduino projects that I've created, including schematics for each project

## [SongPlayer - We Didn't start the fire](https://github.com/MeshanKhosla/Arduino-Projects/tree/master/Projects/SongPlayer_-_We_didn_t_start_the_fire)
I used 5 LEDs, a passive buzzer, and an Arduino Notes library to create the melody for "We Didn't Start The Fire" by Billy Joel.
